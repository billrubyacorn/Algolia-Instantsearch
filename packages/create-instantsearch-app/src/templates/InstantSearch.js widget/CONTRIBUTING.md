# Contribution Guide

## Test

The tests are written in `/src/__tests__` and use Jest.

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

An example can be found in the `example` directory.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## Release

```bash
npm run release
# or
yarn release
```

### First Release

```bash
npm run release -- --first-release
# or
yarn release --first-release
```

This will tag a release without bumping the version.

When you are ready, push the git tag and run `npm publish`.

If you want to publish it as a public scoped package, run `npm publish --access public` the first time.
